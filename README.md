# **TinyML Repository**
This repository is my collection of TinyML project where I also developed a few little scripts to make an (embedded) machine learning engineer's life a little bit easier. All my solutions are built and tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

## **What is TinyML**
*"TinyML is a type of machine learning that shrinks deep learning networks to fit on tiny hardware. It brings together Artificial Intelligence and intelligent devices. It is 45x18mm of Artificial Intelligence in your pocket ([Source])"* (https://www.plugandplaytechcenter.com/resources/tinyml-making-smart-devices-tinier-ever/). But Since neuronal networks may be not always feasible, I also count "classic" machine learning approaches as part of TinyML.
